## On Failure

1. Read the JSON line on stdout (not stderr): `error.code` says what failed, `error.hint` what to do next, `error.retryable` whether the same command can run again unchanged.
2. Act on the exit code and `error.code` (tables below). A click, type or request timeout has `retryable: false` and says "state unknown": the action can have happened.
3. Run `mm describe-screen` (or `mm wait-for`) to see the state before you retry.
4. Capture `mm screenshot --name "debug"` for diagnosis.
5. If the cause is not in the app, read the [daemon log](#daemon-log).

Success has no `ok` field, and `mm stop` prints plain text. For the exact JSON shape, see [Output and Errors](cli-reference.md#output-and-errors).

## Exit Codes

| Exit | Meaning                                                | Do                                                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | ok                                                     |                                                                       |
| 1    | anything else (internal, tool failure, unknown code)   | Read `error.message`                                                  |
| 2    | usage or validation; nothing ran                       | Fix the command                                                       |
| 3    | no session, daemon not running, daemon connection lost | `mm launch`; after `MM_DAEMON_CONNECTION_LOST` check the screen first |
| 4    | target not found or not actionable                     | `mm describe-screen`, then re-target, scroll or dismiss the keyboard  |
| 5    | timeout (click, type or request: action state unknown) | `mm describe-screen` before any retry                                 |
| 6    | platform, device, Metro or Hermes not available        | Check the device, Metro and the build                                 |
| 7    | daemon version mismatch (reserved)                     |                                                                       |

| Ref click fails at once with `MM_TARGET_NOT_FOUND`      | Removed, re-mounted or changed text after the snapshot                 | Expected; `mm describe-screen` and re-target                       |
| `MM_CLICK_FAILED`: strict mode violation (exit 4)       | A fallback ref or an explicit selector/testId matches several elements | Target by `--testid`/`--selector`; scope it with `--within`        |

## Daemon Log

`.mm-daemon.log` at the project root records every request with its outcome:

```text
[2026-11-13T15:25:10.579Z] [INFO] POST /tool/click 200 ok=false code=MM_TARGET_NOT_FOUND 2050ms
[2026-11-13T13:54:23.290Z] [INFO] POST /tool/scroll_to_element 200 ok=false code=MM_WAIT_TIMEOUT 2063ms
```

A failed tool call still answers HTTP 200 and puts the failure in the body, so the status code is not the outcome. Run `grep ok=false .mm-daemon.log` to list the failed calls of a run. A `run_steps` line with failed steps adds `failed=<n>/<total>` and the first failed step's code: `POST /tool/run_steps 200 ok=true failed=1/3 code=MM_WAIT_TIMEOUT …`.
